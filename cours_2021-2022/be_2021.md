## Part 1:

- What is a ros publisher ?
- What is a ros subscriber ?
- List 3 ros message types ?

## Part 2: A simple publisher
Write a simple Ros publisher in python that publish on the topic /counter a number that is increment each 3 seconds.
The message should be published each second.

## Part 3: Obstacle avoidance
In this exercice you have to code a simple obstacle avoidance system for the turtlebot. Here is a video of the avoidance result: https://youtu.be/nsdixTXz4V0

### Step 1

Launch the turtle bot in the gazebo simulator using the following command:

```sh
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
roslaunch /opt/ros/melodic/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch/turtlebot3_world.launch
```

For ros noetic:

```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
roslaunch /opt/ros/noetic/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch/turtlebot3_world.launch
```


#### Question 1:

What are the topics published by the turtlebot ?

#### Question 2:

Visualize the turtlebot and the sensors in rviz using the fixed frame base_scan in global option.

#### Question 3:
- What is the type of the messages on /scan ?
- Use the commande line tools to display a message on /scan.
- Visualize /scan topic in rviz


#### Question 4:
Move the robot by using the rostopic command. In an other terminal print the /scan topic ?

#### Question 5:

In order to avoid obstacles, you are going to use the messages available on the /scan topic. They correspond to the depth information projected on a 2D plan. Describe the step that you want to follow in order to achieve the obstacle avoidance behavior.


#### Question 6:
Complete the following code to implement a similar behavior to the one displayed in the video.

Tips:
- To get the minimum value of a list you can use min(my_list) in python. (warning this function will fail if the list is empty. Use a try except block to handle this case).

```python
import rospy

from geometry_msgs.msg import  XXX  #  <<-- replace XXX with the correct type use for cmd topic

# TODO: import the LaserScan msg from sensors_msgs package :
from sensor_msgs.msg import XXX

rospy.init_node("TurtleBotPythonNode")
topic_cmd = '/mobile_base/commands/velocity'
cmd_publisher = rospy.Publisher(XXX ,XXX , queue_size=1)


cur_laserscan = LaserScan()
def laserscan_callback(data):
    global cur_laserscan
    cur_laserscan = XXX  # <-- replace XXX here
    # print the current laser scan messag:
    print(XXX)


laser_scan_subscriber = rospy.Subscriber(XXX, XXX, XXX)  #<-- complete here

# define a while loop function that will allows to move the robot forward, and turn if there is an obstacle:
while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    # COMPLETE HERE
    # ....


```

#### Question bonus:
- Run your program on the real turtlebot.
- Add some objects / walls to the simulated environment.
